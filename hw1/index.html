        <h1>Lionel Messi</h1>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi#See_also">Actual Wiki Page</a>
        <p>Lionel Andrés Messi, also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward 
            for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team. Often considered the best 
            player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record 
            seven Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon 
            d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, 
            where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA 
            Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La 
            Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions 
            League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds 
            the record for most international goals by a South American male (80). Messi has scored over 750 senior career 
            goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club. </p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel 
                factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his 
                father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the 
                northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily 
                Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the 
                sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, 
                Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club 
                Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, 
                Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh 
                birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to 
                his grandmother.
            </p>
            <h2>Public Reception</h2>
            <p>A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20. Diego Maradona 
                considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly 
                after winning the Ballon d'Or, commented, "I'm not even the best at Barça", in reference to his protégé. Four years later, 
                after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved 
                beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. An early 
                proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had 
                ever seen. In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current 
                players, and by the end of Barça's second treble-winning season, Messi's superiority, ahead of Maradona and Pelé, had 
                become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe. He initially received several dismissals by 
                critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina, until he won his 
                first international trophy at the 2021 Copa América.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles 
                as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood 
                idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the "New Maradona" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond 
                all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona. Jorge Valdano, 
                who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, "Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, 
                Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico." César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup 
                victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays "at the level of the best Maradona". Other notable 
                Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi 
                has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.</p>
            <p>In Argentine society, Messi is generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived 
                uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in 
                some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to 
                greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. An enduring mark 
                against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as 
                an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste 
                shirt (he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false 
                perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine. Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected 
                the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: "Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing 
                myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy." Moreover, several pundits and footballing 
                figures, including Maradona, have also questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.
            </p>
            <h2>Style of Play</h2>
            <p>Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, 
                allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La 
                Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, 
                which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from 
                opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs 
                allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when 
                dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster 
                with the ball than he does without it." Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi 
                is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses 
                the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.</p>
            <p>A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking 
                runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. 
                He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.
                Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of August 2021, Messi ranks 11th all time in goals 
                scored from direct free kicks with 58, the most among active players. He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.
            </p>
            <p>Messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during 
                counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best 
                dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina 
                manager Diego Maradona has said of him, "The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've 
                never seen anyone with Messi's ball control." Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working 
                team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.
            </p>
            <p>As his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper 
                areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. His work-rate off the 
                ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and 
                instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional 
                play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular 
                season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his 
                injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the 
                Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been 
                employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or 
                in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.
